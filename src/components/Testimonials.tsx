This was our first renovation in our new prototype, so there was a lot riding on it, and you and your team made it a real pleasure. The most impressive thing to me was when your team came across a challenge; they always came to me with a viable solution. From the start to the finish, it went very smoothly. I was also impressed with the professionalism of you and your team. I look forward to working with you and your team again in the future.",
